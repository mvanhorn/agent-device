# ADR 0014: Direct Maestro Compatibility Engine

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Maestro YAML currently compiles into generic `SessionAction` strings. Commands whose semantics do not
match native replay become private `__maestro*` names with positional payloads, then replay dispatch
routes those strings through a second Maestro switch before recursively invoking ordinary daemon
commands. Compatibility state is split between the replay variable scope and three `WeakMap` caches.

This path grew a second selector resolver, several polling loops, action-after-assertion recovery, and
gesture-coordinate adapters. The indirection makes successful responses hard to prove: a fast native
wait may establish text existence while the compatibility assertion requires a visible Maestro target.
It also hides authored coordinate space until runtime positional decoding.

The current inbound implementation is about 5,000 production lines and 5,000 focused test lines.
Android compatibility is materially faster than native Maestro in the pager and navigation suites;
that advantage is a product constraint, not expendable migration headroom.

ADR 0013 separately owns public gesture normalization, contact topology, trajectory planning, and
native injection. Maestro's supported gesture surface is single-pointer swipe only.

## Decision

Parse supported Maestro YAML into a source-preserving typed program and execute it directly through a
narrow compatibility runtime port. Do not lower the program through `SessionAction`, private command
names, positional JSON, or recursive daemon command routing.

The engine has five responsibilities:

1. The parser validates the supported grammar and preserves source path and line on every command.
2. The interpreter owns hooks, includes, environment scopes, conditions, repeat/retry, and ordered
   command execution.
3. The runtime port exposes typed app, input, observation, target, and single-pointer gesture
   operations backed by the existing agent-device runtime and platform adapters.
4. One explicit execution context owns variables and the current observation generation. A mutation
   invalidates that generation; reads may reuse evidence only within the same generation.
5. An observer adapts source-aware progress, traces, artifacts, and failures to the existing replay and
   test result contracts.

The engine does not implement platform input. Absolute swipes resolve without a viewport query.
Percentage and preset swipes resolve against the cheapest fresh interaction viewport available.
Target-relative swipes reuse the target-resolution observation. The resulting typed single-pointer
motion enters ADR 0013 after public compatibility normalization. Maestro code cannot construct or
execute two-pointer pan, pinch, rotate, transform, or physical pointer trajectories.

Simple successful target queries return their match, visibility decision, frame, candidate count, and
observation generation in one response. The engine must not capture a second hierarchy merely to
verify evidence already returned by that query. Relational or ambiguous selectors may use a full-tree
fallback. Raw hierarchies, screenshots, and complete candidate lists are failure/debug artifacts, not
happy-path requirements.

Upstream Maestro is a version-pinned development oracle, not a production dependency. Opt-in fixture
generation and scheduled conformance runs compare syntax, normalized command intent, and app-observable
outcomes. Normal unit CI consumes checked-in normalized fixtures and requires neither Java nor an
installed Maestro CLI.

## Performance Contract

The migration cannot switch production routing until Android and iOS satisfy all of these on the pager
and react-navigation corpora:

- total wall time is no slower than the pre-migration compatibility engine;
- successful simple target operations perform at most one provider query;
- hierarchy capture count does not increase;
- absolute coordinate swipes perform no viewport or accessibility capture;
- percentage swipe conversion preserves authored endpoints exactly;
- helper/runner startup remains amortized across a suite;
- p50/p95 command latency, captures, retries, and transferred hierarchy bytes are reported separately;
- failure-only diagnostics are excluded from happy-path latency comparisons.

Android verification must prove the bundled helper backend and version. iOS verification must separate
runner startup from warm command latency. Both platforms rerun the non-Maestro gesture canaries; their
two-pointer plans, executor selection, and app-observable effects must remain unchanged.

## Migration

1. Add the typed program, runtime port, direct interpreter, and normalized upstream fixtures without
   changing production routing.
2. Differentially compare the old lowering path and direct engine at the typed operation boundary.
3. Move lifecycle, input, screenshot, and keyboard commands.
4. Move target queries and assertions, deleting unverified fast-path success and assertion-triggered
   action replay.
5. Move single-pointer swipes through ADR 0013's normalized input boundary.
6. Move hooks, includes, conditions, repeat/retry, and trusted `runScript`.
7. Switch `--maestro` atomically, then delete private Maestro commands, positional decoding, hidden
   caches, and obsolete converter/runtime tests.

The old and new engines may coexist only in tests during migration. Shipping two production engines or
a runtime fallback between them is rejected because it doubles semantic and performance ownership.

## Consequences

- Maestro remains a supported subset with explicit failures; this refactor does not expand parity.
- Source provenance and runtime values stay typed through execution.
- Compatibility policy remains local while device behavior stays in shared runtimes and backends.
- Cross-platform correctness may require richer provider query evidence, but not additional round trips.
- ADR 0013 can be rewritten internally without changing Maestro as long as its normalized
  single-pointer boundary and executor guarantees remain available.

## Alternatives Considered

- Embed upstream Orchestra: rejected because Java startup, package weight, driver ownership, and
  platform coverage would erase performance and backend advantages.
- Build a shared replay VM first: rejected until native `.ad` needs structured runtime control flow;
  one caller does not justify a broader abstraction.
- Keep compiling to typed `SessionAction` variants: rejected because it retains the replay trampoline
  and prevents the compatibility engine from owning observation generations directly.
